# Event processing in action

Authors: Opher Etzion and Peter Niblett
Published: 2011 by Manning Publications Co

In this book we have taken a top-down approach by describing the concepts (the forest), and then providing the reader an opportunity to view the trees (representatives of the different approaches) and experiment with them. Different from the bottom-up approach of describing a single language or
product.

we use definitions that are consistent with the terminology established by the Event Processing Technical Society (EPTS)

- Chapter 1 is the entry point, with some examples and basic terms. It introduces the Fast Flower Delivery example.
- Chapter 2 explains basic architectural and programming principles.
- Chapter 3 deals with events: event types, event schema descriptions, and relationships among event types.
- Chapter 4 deals with event producers: the types of event producers and the ways events are obtained from a producer.
- Chapter 5 covers event consumers: the types of event consumers, and some current examples.
- Chapter 6 deals with the event processing network, a key concept in event processing, and its associated building blocks, such as event processing agents, channels, and global state elements.
- Chapter 7 discusses the notion of context and its major role in event processing.
- Chapter 8 looks in greater detail at event processing agents that filter and transform events.
- Chapter 9 examines event pattern matching, the jewel in the crown of event processing.
- Chapter 10 surveys implementation issues, both engineering aspects, such as scalability, and software engineering aspects, such as programming style and
development tools.
- Chapter 11 surveys some of the semantic challenges that developers and users of event processing systems should be aware of, in order to avoid anomalies when building event processing applications.
- Chapter 12 discusses emerging trends and technology directions in the area of event processing.
