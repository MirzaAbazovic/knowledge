# Chapter 1 Introduction

Let me paraphrase Albert Allen Bartlett "The greatest shortcoming of the developers is our inability to understand threding".

Threading-related problems are hard to detect, bugs they produce do not manifest themselfs predictably, so they (often) appear in production.

There are low-level mechanisims and design-level policies.

"The language provides low-level mechanisms such as synchronization and condition waits, but these
mechanisms must be used consistently to implement application-level protocols or policies."

"To address the abstraction mismatch between Javaâ€™s low-level mechanisms and the necessary design-level policies, we present a simplified set of rules for writing concurrent programs."
