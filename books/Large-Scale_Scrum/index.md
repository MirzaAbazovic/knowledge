## Preface

Power in the marketplace moved from seller to buyer, the customer, not the firm, became the center of commercial universe.

LeSS shows how to **handle large and complex development.**

LeSS strives for a balance between abstract principles and concrete practices.

LeSS is not process or technique it is framework.

**Product group not project group - emphasises product and customer.**

**Matrixed project organisation should not exist in LeSS Line organisation**

**Line manager** - a manager you report to in the line of organisation.
First-level manager - is the direct line manager you report to.

**Senior manager/Executive** - Manager near the top of org. 

**Product management or product marketing** - Explore the market and decide on the content of the product. This is not in line with relation with teams.

**Head of product group** - The manager who heads the product group to which all people in the product group report in a line relationship.

**Project/program manager** - Role traditionally responsible for the schedule of a release. This is normally not a line relationship with the team as it has a short-term temporary focus. **These roles should not exist in a LeSS organization.**

**Functional organization** - Line organization for a functional skill such as development, test, or analysis. **Should cease to exist in a LeSS organization.**

## LeSS

### One-team Scrum

Each **timeboxed** Sprint, a potentially **shippable product** increment is delivered and, ideally, shipped. A **single Product Owner** is responsible for maximizing product value, prioritizing items in the **Product Backlog**, and adaptively deciding the goal of each Sprint based on constant feedback and learning. A small Team is responsible for delivering the Sprint goal; there are no limiting single-specialized roles. A **Scrum Master** teaches why Scrum and how to derive value with it, coaches the Product Owner, Team, and organization to apply it, and acts as a mirror. **There is no project manager or team lead.**

In the Scrum Guide and Scrum Primer, the **emphasis is for one Team**; the focus is not many Teams working together. And that naturally leads to thinking about large-scale Scrum.

**LeSS is Scrum applied to many teams working together on one product.**

...applied to many teams—Cross-functional, cross-component, **full-stack feature teams** of 3–9 **learning-focused people** that **do it all**—from UX to code to videos—to create done items and a shippable product.

...working together—The teams are working together because they have a common goal to deliver one common shippable product at the end of a common Sprint, and each team cares about this because they are a feature team responsible for the whole, not a part.

...on one product—What product? A broad complete **end-to-end customer-centric solution that real customers use**. It’s not a component, platform, layer, or library.


Today, the two LeSS frameworks (smaller LeSS and LeSS Huge) have been adopted in big groups worldwide in disparate domains.

There are no such things as best practices in product development. There are only practices that are adequate within a certain context.


**We don’t want more roles because more roles leads to less responsibility to Teams**. 

**We don’t want more artifacts because more artifacts leads to a greater distance between Teams and customers**.

**We don’t want more process because that leads to less learning and team ownership of process.** 
Instead **we want more responsible Teams by having less (fewer) roles,we want more customer-focused Teams** building useful products by **having less artifacts**, we want more **Team ownership of process** and **more meaningful work by having less defined processes**. We want more with less.

**Whole-product focus** — One Product Backlog, one Product Owner, one shippable product, one Sprint—regardless if 3 or 33 teams. Customers want valuable functionality in a cohesive product, not technical components in separate parts.
